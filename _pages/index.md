# Welcome to TheRedP4nther's Cave! 🐾

## About Me

Hi, I’m TheRedP4nther — a passionate cybersecurity enthusiast and Junior Pentester focused on web exploitation, privilege escalation, and Active Directory.

I’m currently eJPT certified and preparing for the OSCP, with hands-on experience from solving 170+ Hack The Box machines. I enjoy building scripts in Bash and Python to automate tasks and deepen my understanding of vulnerabilities.

## Purpose

This blog is my space to document learning, share detailed writeups, and help others grow in the field. Whether you’re new to cybersecurity or sharpening your skills, I hope these resources prove helpful.

Thanks for stopping by — stay curious and keep hacking!
