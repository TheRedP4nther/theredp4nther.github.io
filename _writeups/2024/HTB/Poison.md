# Enumeration:

<br />

We begin with a standard `nmap` scan to identify open ports and running services:

<br />

```bash
‚ùØ nmap -p- 10.10.10.84  --open --min-rate 5000 -sS -T5 -Pn -n -sCV
Starting Nmap 7.94SVN ( https://nmap.org ) at 2025-08-06 20:29 CEST
Nmap scan report for 10.10.10.84
Host is up (0.042s latency).
Not shown: 60743 filtered tcp ports (no-response), 4790 closed tcp ports (reset)
Some closed ports may be reported as filtered due to --defeat-rst-ratelimit
