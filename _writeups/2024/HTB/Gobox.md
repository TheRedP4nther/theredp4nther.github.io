# Introduction:

<br />



<br />

# Enumeration:

<br />

We start by running the typical `nmap` scan to see which ports are open:

<br />

```bash
‚ùØ nmap -p- 10.10.11.113 --open --min-rate 5000 -sS -T5 -Pn -n -sCV
Starting Nmap 7.94SVN ( https://nmap.org ) at 2025-04-16 17:33 CEST
Nmap scan report for 10.10.11.113
Host is up (0.044s latency).
Not shown: 65413 closed tcp ports (reset), 118 filtered tcp ports (no-response)
Some closed ports may be reported as filtered due to --defeat-rst-ratelimit

Open Ports:

- `Port 22` -> ssh 

- `Port 80` -> http

- `Port 4566` -> internal service (?)

- `Port 8080` -> http

<br />

# Http Enumeration: -> Port 80

<br />

List the website on this port:

<br />

<br />

It's a page dedicated to a `eSports` hacking competition, but we don't see nothing `relevant`.

So we keep enumerating the next port.

<br />

# Http Enumeration: -> Port 8080

<br />

The front page of the other website is a `login panel`:

<br />

We try default `passwords` but doesn't work.

<br />

So we click on the "`Forgot Password`" option and see this:
