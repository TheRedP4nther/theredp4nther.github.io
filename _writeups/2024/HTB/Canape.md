# Introduction:

# Enumeration:

<br />

We start by running the typical `nmap` scan to see which ports are open:

<br />

```bash
‚ùØ nmap -p- 10.10.10.70 --open --min-rate 5000 -sS -T5 -Pn -n -sCV
Starting Nmap 7.94SVN ( https://nmap.org ) at 2025-02-01 19:13 CET

<br />

Enumerating manually the page we found two interesting paths.

<br />

### 1.- /quotes:

<br />

Contains the most typical quotations of some characters in the series.

<br />

<br />

### 2.- /submit:

<br />

It has a couple of interesting inputs to test.
