# Introduction:

<br />



<br />

# Enumeration:

<br />

We start by running the typical `nmap` scan to see which ports are open:

<br />

```bash
‚ùØ nmap -p- 10.10.11.59 --open --min-rate 5000 -sS -T5 -Pn -n -sCV
Starting Nmap 7.94SVN ( https://nmap.org ) at 2025-03-07 15:14 CET
Nmap scan report for 10.10.11.59
Host is up (0.044s latency).
Not shown: 64946 closed tcp ports (reset), 587 filtered tcp ports (no-response)
Some closed ports may be reported as filtered due to --defeat-rst-ratelimit
PORT   STATE SERVICE VERSION

```

<br />

Open Ports:

`Port 22` -> ssh

`Port 80` -> http 

<br />

# Http Enumeration: -> Port 80

<br />

When we are going to list the `website` it redirects to -> `strutted.htb`, so we proceed to add it to the `/etc/hosts`:

<br />

```bash
echo "10.10.11.59 strutted.htb" >> /etc/hosts
```

<br />

Once done, we list the `website` again:

<br />

Before anything, at the `bottom` of the page it says that we can `download` the `code` of the `application` in a `.zip` file. So we go to `"Download"` at the `top right` and we do it.

<br />

As we can see, it seems to be a `utility` to `upload` images, let's `test` uploading one:

<br />

![3](../../../assets/images/Strutted/3.png)

<br />

## Apache Struts: 

<br />

The image has been `uploaded` withouth troubles and if we `inspect` the source `code` of the `"Copy Shareable Link"` we can access to the `path` in where it is `stored`.

But this `isn't` important, the most `important` thing is that when we `upload` an image, the page `redirects` to an endpoint called `upload.action`:

<br />

-> `http://strutted.htb/upload.action`

<br />

And as we `well` know, the presence of `.action` scripts `means` that `Apache Struts` is behind the `application`.
