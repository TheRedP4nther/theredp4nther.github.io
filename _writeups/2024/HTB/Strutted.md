# Introduction:

<br />



<br />

# Enumeration:

<br />

We start by running the typical `nmap` scan to see which ports are open:

<br />

```bash
‚ùØ nmap -p- 10.10.11.59 --open --min-rate 5000 -sS -T5 -Pn -n -sCV
Starting Nmap 7.94SVN ( https://nmap.org ) at 2025-03-07 15:14 CET
Nmap scan report for 10.10.11.59
Host is up (0.044s latency).
Not shown: 64946 closed tcp ports (reset), 587 filtered tcp ports (no-response)
Some closed ports may be reported as filtered due to --defeat-rst-ratelimit

```

<br />

Open Ports:

`Port 22` -> ssh

`Port 80` -> http 

<br />

# Http Enumeration: -> Port 80

<br />

When we are going to list the `website` it redirects to -> `strutted.htb`, so we proceed to add it to the `/etc/hosts`:

<br />

```bash
echo "10.10.11.59 strutted.htb" >> /etc/hosts
```

<br />

Once done, we list the `website` again:

<br />

![2](../../../assets/images/Strutted/2.png)

<br />

Before anything, at the `bottom` of the page it says that we can `download` the `structure` of the `application` in a `.zip` file. So we go to `"Download"` at the `top right` and we do it.

<br />

![5](../../../assets/images/Strutted/5.png)

<br />

As we can see, it seems to be an `utility` to `upload` images, let's `test` uploading one:

<br />

![3](../../../assets/images/Strutted/3.png)

<br />

## Apache Struts: 

<br />

The image has been `uploaded` withouth troubles and if we `inspect` the `source code` of the `"Copy Shareable Link"` button, we can find the `path` in where it is `stored`:

<br />

![6](../../../assets/images/Strutted/6.png)

<br />

But that's not the `key` point, `crucial` part is that when we `upload` an `image`, the page `redirects` to an `endpoint` called `"upload.action"`:

<br />

-> `http://strutted.htb/upload.action`

<br />

And as we `well` know, the presence of `.action` scripts `means` that `Apache Struts` is behind the `application`.

<br />

![4](../../../assets/images/Strutted/4.png)

<br />

If we `remember`, we have `access` to the `source code`, so we can take a `look` and try to `find` the Apache Struts `version` in `use`.

After a time `looking` for this, we find the version `6.3.0.1` in the `"pom.xml"` file:

<br />

```xml
<properties>
    <project.build.sourceEncoding>UTF-8</project.build.sourceEncoding>
    <maven.compiler.source>17</maven.compiler.source>
    <maven.compiler.target>17</maven.compiler.target>
    <struts2.version>6.3.0.1</struts2.version>
    <jetty-plugin.version>9.4.46.v20220331</jetty-plugin.version>
    <maven.javadoc.skip>true</maven.javadoc.skip>
    <jackson.version>2.14.1</jackson.version>
    <jackson-data-bind.version>2.14.1</jackson-data-bind.version>
</properties>
```

<br />

Once we know that, we search `vulnerabilities` for this `version` and there is a very recent one, the `CVE-2024-53677`.

<br />

## Apache Struts File Upload Vulnerability:

<br />

The CVE `consists` in a `file upload` vulnerability that allows an `attacker` to upload a malicious `.jsp` file as a `webshell` and consequently, achieve a `RCE` on the victim system. 

This [post](https://www.dynatrace.com/news/blog/tracing-apache-struts-cve-2024-53677/) explains very well the `vulnerability`. It says that `Apache Struts` has a number of  `interceptors` classes by default, including one called `"FileUploadInterceptor"`.

The `FileUploadInterceptor` class is the `key` to the `exploitation` because it allows us to `manipulate` the `file's` storage location on the server `before` it is `processed`. 

This happens because `FileUploadInterceptor` does not properly sanitize file `paths` when handling uploads. By `manipulating` the request parameters, we can perform a `path traversal` attack to store files `outside` the intended `directory`. If we upload a `.jsp` file to a web-accessible location, we can achieve `RCE` when the server processes it.

<br />

### Manual Exploitation:

<br />

Now are going to exploit the vuln `manually` step by step using the following [POC](https://github.com/EQSTLab/CVE-2024-53677) in where we can `found` the parameters that we need to `set`:

<br />

```python
def exploit(self) -> None:
        files = {
            'Upload': ("exploit_file.jsp", self.file_content, 'text/plain'),
            'top.UploadFileName': (None, self.path),
        }

        try:
            response = requests.post(self.url, files=files)
            print("Status Code:", response.status_code)
            print("Response Text:", response.text)
            if response.status_code == 200:
                print("File uploaded successfully.")
            else:
                print("Failed to upload file.")
        except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
            print(f"Request failed: {e}")
```

<br />

1.- First, we open `Burp Suite` and `intercept` a random image `upload` request `removing` the `unnecessary` data from the image:

<br />

![7](../../../assets/images/Strutted/7.png)

<br />

2.- Now, we change `"upload"` to `"Upload"` to activate the interceptor being able to `intercept` the file `before` it is uploaded. We also add a `java oneliner` to the image `data`:

<br />

![8](../../../assets/images/Strutted/8.png)

<br />

3.- Then, we need to `add` a second file parameter to use the `interceptor` and `rename` the file using a `Path Traversal` and `.jsp` extension:

<br />



<br />

4.- And finally, we visit `"/uploads/20250308_151823/../../hello.jsp"` to see the file uploaded:

<br />
