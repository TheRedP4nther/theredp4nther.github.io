# Introduction:

<br />



<br />

# Enumeration:

<br />

We start by running the typical `nmap` scan to see which ports are open:

<br />

```bash
‚ùØ nmap -p- 10.10.11.59 --open --min-rate 5000 -sS -T5 -Pn -n -sCV
Starting Nmap 7.94SVN ( https://nmap.org ) at 2025-03-07 15:14 CET
Nmap scan report for 10.10.11.59
Host is up (0.044s latency).
Not shown: 64946 closed tcp ports (reset), 587 filtered tcp ports (no-response)
Some closed ports may be reported as filtered due to --defeat-rst-ratelimit
PORT   STATE SERVICE VERSION
22/tcp open  ssh     OpenSSH 8.9p1 Ubuntu 3ubuntu0.10 (Ubuntu Linux; protocol 2.0)

Service detection performed. Please report any incorrect results at https://nmap.org/submit/ .
Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 21.75 seconds
```

<br />

Open Ports:

`Port 22` -> ssh

`Port 80` -> http 

<br />

# Http Enumeration: -> Port 80

<br />

When we are going to list the website it redirects to -> strutted.htb, so we proceed to add it to the /etc/hosts:

<br />

```bash
echo "10.10.11.59 strutted.htb" >> /etc/hosts
```
