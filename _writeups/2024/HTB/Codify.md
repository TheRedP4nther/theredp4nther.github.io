# Introduction:

<br />


 
<br />

# Enumeration:

<br />

As always we start with a nmap scan:

<br />

```bash
‚ùØ nmap -sCV -p22,80 10.10.11.239 -oN targeted

<br />

Only ports 22 and 80 are open, so we obviously proceed to list the website.

# Web Enumeration:

<br />

As soon as we enter we see a text that tells us that the website has a sandbox that will allow us to execute javascript code in real time with some limitations:

<br />

![1](../../../assets/images/Codify/2.png)

<br />

Click in "Try it now" to access to the sandbox and once in the path we test the console a bit and we see that we can really execute javascript code:

<br />

We continue to list the website and discover a /about path where we see that the website uses the vm2 sandboxing library:

<br />

<br />

# Find Vulnerability:

<br />

Immediately performed a google search and discovered that this library has a vulnerability which allows an attacker to bypass sandbox limitations and execute arbitrary code on the Victim Machine:

<br />

We continue to search for this vulnerability until we find a payload to exploit it:

<br />

<br />

We copy the payload, paste it into the console and successfully execute a command as the "svc" user:
